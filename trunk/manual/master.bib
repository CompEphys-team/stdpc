  abstract = {Experimental observations of the intracellular recorded electrical
	activity in individual neurons show that the temporal behavior is
	often chaotic. We discuss both our own observations on a cell from
	the stomatogastric central pattern generator of lobster and earlier
	observations in other cells. In this paper we work with models with
	chaotic neurons, building on models by Hindmarsh and Rose for bursting,
	spiking activity in neurons. The key feature of these simplified
	models of neurons is the presence of coupled slow and fast subsystems.
	We analyze the model neurons using the same tools employed in the
	analysis of our experimental data. We couple two model neurons both
	electrotonically and electrochemically in inhibitory and excitatory
	fashions. In each of these cases, we demonstrate that the model neurons
	can synchronize in phase and out of phase depending on the strength
	of the coupling. For normal synaptic coupling, we have a time delay
	between the action of one neuron and the response of the other. We
	also analyze how the synchronization depends on this delay. A rich
	spectrum of synchronized behaviors is possible for electrically coupled
	neurons and for inhibitory coupling between neurons. In synchronous
	neurons one typically sees chaotic motion of the coupled neurons.
	Excitatory coupling produces essentially periodic voltage trajectories,
	which are also synchronized. We display and discuss these synchronized
	behaviors using two "distance" measures of the synchronization.},

  abstract = {The electrical activity of a neuron is strongly dependent on the ionic
	channels present in its membrane. Modifying the maximal conductances
	from these channels can have a dramatic impact on neuron behavior.
	But the effect of such modifications can also be cancelled out by
	compensatory mechanisms among different channels. We used an evolution
	strategy with a fitness function based on phase-plane analysis to
	obtain 20 very different computational models of the cerebellar Purkinje
	cell. All these models produced very similar outputs to current injections,
	including tiny details of the complex firing pattern. These models
	were not completely isolated in the parameter space, but neither
	did they belong to a large continuum of good models that would exist
	if weak compensations between channels were sufficient. The parameter
	landscape of good models can best be described as a set of loosely
	connected hyperplanes. Our method is efficient in finding good models
	in this complex landscape. Unraveling the landscape is an important
	step towards the understanding of functional homeostasis of neurons.},

	connections from the input layer and form a recurrent network among
	themselves. Each class is represented by a prelearned attractor (serving
	as an associative hook) in the recurrent net corresponding to a randomly
	selected subpopulation of the perceptrons. In training, first the
	attractor of the correct class is activated among the perceptrons;
	then the visual stimulus is presented at the input layer. The feedforward
	connections are modified using field-dependent Hebbian learning with
	positive synapses, which we show to be stable with respect to large
	variations in feature statistics and coding levels and allows the
	use of the same threshold on all perceptrons. Recognition is based
	on only the visual stimuli. These activate the recurrent network,
	which is then driven by the dynamics to a sustained attractor state,
	concentrated in the correct class subset and providing a form of
	working memory. We believe this architecture is more transparent
	than standard feedforward two-layer networks and has stronger biological

  abstract = {Precise coordination across hemispheres is a critical feature of many
	complex motor circuits. In the avian song system the robust nucleus
	of the arcopallium (RA) plays a key role in such coordination. It
	is simultaneously the major output structure for the descending vocal
	motor pathway, and it also sends inputs to structures in the brain
	stem and thalamus that project bilaterally back to the forebrain.
	Because all birds lack a corpus callosum and the anterior commissure
	does not interconnect any of the song control nuclei directly, these
	bottom-up connections form the only pathway that can coordinate activity
	across hemispheres. In this study, we show that unilateral lesions
	of RA in adult male zebra finches (Taeniopigia guttata) completely
	and permanently disrupt the bird's stereotyped song. In contrast,
	lesions of RA in juvenile birds do not prevent the acquisition of
	normal song as adults. These results highlight the importance of
	hemispheric interdependence once the circuit is established but show
	that one hemisphere is sufficient for complex vocal behavior if this
	interdependence is prevented during a critical period of development.
	The ability of birds to sing with a single RA provides the opportunity
	to test the effect of targeted microlesions in RA without confound
	of functional compensation from the contralateral RA. We show that
	microlesions cause significant changes in song temporal structure
	and implicate RA as playing a major part in the generation of song
	temporal patterns. These findings implicate a dual role for RA, first
	as part of the program generator for song and second as part of the
	circuit that mediates interhemispheric coordination.},

	provides a link between large-scale EEG recordings and cellular plasticity
	mechanisms. Here, we focus on the role of neuronal synchronization
	in different frequency domains for the subsequent stages of memory
	formation. Recent EEG studies suggest that synchronized neural activity
	in the gamma frequency range (around 30-100 Hz) plays a functional
	role for the formation of declarative long-term memories in humans.
	On the cellular level, gamma synchronization between hippocampal
	and parahippocampal regions may induce LTP in the CA3 region of the
	hippocampus. In order to encode spatial locations or sequences of
	multiple items and to guarantee a defined temporal order of memory
	processing, synchronization in the gamma frequency range has to be
	accompanied by a stimulus-locked phase reset of ongoing theta oscillations.
	Simultaneous gamma- and theta-dependent plasticity leads to complex
	learning rules required for realistic declarative memory formation.
	Subsequently, consolidation of declarative memories may occur via
	replay of newly acquired patterns in so-called sharp wave-ripple
	complexes, predominantly during slow-wave sleep. These irregular
	bursts induce longer lasting forms of synaptic plasticity in output
	regions of the hippocampus and in the neocortex. In summary, synchronization
	of neural assemblies in different frequency ranges induces specific
	forms of cellular plasticity during subsequent stages of memory formation.},

	by the interaction between E-cells and Icells (excitatory and inhibitory
	cells). The I-cells gate and synchronize the E-cells, and the E-cells
	drive and synchronize the I-cells. We refer to rhythms generated
	in this way as PING (pyramidal-interneuronal gamma) rhythms. The
	PING mechanism requires that the drive I(I) to the I-cells be sufficiently
	low; the rhythm is lost when I(I) gets too large. This can happen
	in at least two ways. In the first mechanism, the I-cells spike in
	synchrony, but get ahead of the E-cells, spiking without being prompted
	by the E-cells. We call this phase walkthrough of the I-cells. In
	the second mechanism, the I-cells fail to synchronize, and their
	activity leads to complete suppression of the E-cells. Noisy spiking
	in the E-cells, generated by noisy external drive, adds excitatory
	drive to the I-cells and may lead to phase walkthrough. Noisy spiking
	in the I-cells adds inhibition to the E-cells and may lead to suppression
	of the E-cells. An analysis of the conditions under which noise leads
	to phase walkthrough of the I-cells or suppression of the E-cells
	shows that PING rhythms at frequencies far below the gamma range
	are robust to noise only if network parameter values are tuned very
	carefully. Together with an argument explaining why the PING mechanism
	does not work far above the gamma range in the presence of heterogeneity,
	this justifies the "G" in "PING."},

	underlying cholinergic modulation of the pyloric network in the stomatogastric
	ganglion (STG) of the Cape lobster Jasus Ialandii. Bath application
	of the muscarinic agonists muscarine, oxotremorine, and pilocarpine
	on the STG activates a rhythmic pattern from a quiescent pyloric
	network. The mechanisms of this modulation were investigated on individual
	pyloric neurons isolated both from synaptic interactions within the
	network (by photoinactivation of most of the presynaptic neurons
	and pharmacological blockade of the remaining synapses) and from
	central inputs (by a sucrose block of the input nerve). All three
	muscarinic agonists activated bursting and plateau properties of
	all the neurons comprising the pyloric network. The activation was
	dose dependent, and was blocked by the muscarinic antagonists atropine,
	pirenzepine, and scopolamine. The oscillatory behavior triggered
	by the muscarinic stimulation was specific to each type of pyloric
	neuron. The isolated neuron AB had the shortest oscillation period
	and depolarizing phase. The constrictor neurons (LP, PY, IC) were
	the slowest oscillators, and only oscillated upon hyperpolarizing
	current injection. Under muscarinic modulation, the individual bursting
	activities of the isolated pyloric neurons were of the same type
	as their activities when isolated from the network but modulated
	by central inputs (Bal et al., 1988). The VD neuron is an exception
	since it was a rapid oscillator in the latter situation and became
	a slow oscillator when modulated by a single muscarinic agonist.
	To determine the relative importance of the muscarinic-dependent
	bursting properties of the individual pyloric neurons in the operation
	of the intact network, a progressive reconstruction of the synaptic
	circuitry was attempted. We found that under certain conditions of
	muscarinic modulation a new composite pacemaker could be created,
	composed of the electrically coupled VD, AB, and PD neurons. This
	can result in the generation of new pyloric patterns that were very
	sensitive to the membrane potential of individual network neurons.
	The data also confirmed that, in a rhythmic "pattern-generating network,"
	the pacemaker role may not be definitely attributed to a given neuron
	but instead could be assigned to other neurons by modulation of their
	respective oscillatory capabilities.},

  abstract = {Electrical coupling is widespread in developing nervous systems and
	plays a major role in circuit formation and patterning of activity.
	In most reported cases, such coupling between rhythmogenic neurons
	tends to synchronize and enhance their oscillatory behavior, thereby
	producing monophasic rhythmic output. However, in many adult networks,
	such as those responsible for rhythmic motor behavior, oscillatory
	neurons are linked by synaptic inhibition to produce rhythmic output
	with multiple phases. The question then arises whether such networks
	are still able to generate multiphasic output in the early stage
	of development when electrical coupling is abundant. A suitable model
	for addressing this issue is the lobster stomatogastric nervous system
	(STNS). In the adult animal, the STNS consists of three discrete
	neural networks that are comprised of oscillatory neurons interconnected
	by reciprocal inhibition. These networks generate three distinct
	rhythmic motor patterns with large amplitude neuronal oscillations.
	By contrast, in the embryo the same neuronal population expresses
	a single multiphasic rhythm with small-amplitude oscillations. Recent
	findings have revealed that adult-like network properties are already
	present early in the embryonic system but are masked by an as yet
	unknown mechanism. Here we use computer simulation to test whether
	extensive electrical coupling may be involved in masking adult-like
	properties in the embryonic STNS. Our basic model consists of three
	different adult-like STNS networks that are built of relaxation oscillators
	interconnected by reciprocal synaptic inhibition. Individual model
	cells generate slow membrane potential oscillations without action
	potentials. The introduction of widespread electrical coupling between
	members of these networks dampens oscillation amplitudes and, at
	moderate coupling strengths, may coordinate neuronal activity into
	a single rhythm with different phases, which is strongly reminiscent
	of embryonic STNS output. With a further increase in coupling strength,
	the system reaches one of two final states depending on the relative
	contribution of inhibition and inherent oscillatory properties within
	the networks: either fully synchronized and dampened oscillations,
	or a complete collapse of activity. Our simulations indicate that,
	beginning from either of these two states, the emergence of distinct
	adult networks during maturation may arise from a developmental decrease
	in electrical coupling that unmasks preexisting adult-like network
	properties.},

  abstract = {Fast oscillations in neural assemblies have been proposed as a mechanism
	to facilitate stimulus representation in a variety of sensory systems
	across animal species. In the olfactory system, intervention studies
	suggest that oscillations in the gamma frequency range play a role
	in fine odor discrimination. However, there is still no direct evidence
	that such oscillations are intrinsically altered in intact systems
	to aid in stimulus disambiguation. Here we show that gamma oscillatory
	power in the rat olfactory bulb during a two-alternative choice task
	is modulated in the intact system according to task demands with
	dramatic increases in gamma power during discrimination of molecularly
	similar odorants in contrast to dissimilar odorants. This elevation
	in power evolves over the course of criterion performance, is specific
	to the gamma frequency band (65-85 Hz), and is independent of changes
	in the theta or beta frequency band range. Furthermore, these high
	amplitude gamma oscillations are restricted to the olfactory bulb,
	such that concurrent piriform cortex recordings show no evidence
	of enhanced gamma power during these high-amplitude events. Our results
	display no modulation in the power of beta oscillations (15-28 Hz)
	shown previously to increase with odor learning in a Go/No-go task,
	and we suggest that the oscillatory profile of the olfactory system
	may be influenced by both odor discrimination demands and task type.
	The results reported here indicate that enhancement of local gamma
	power may reflect a switch in the dynamics of the system to a strategy
	that optimizes stimulus resolution when input signals are ambiguous.},

	gamma rhythms are generated in area CA3 in vitro and in vivo and
	nonreciprocally projected to area CA1 by the Schaffer collateral
	pathway. Here we demonstrate how this CA3 gamma rhythm generates
	two different patterns of local CA1 oscillation dependent on the
	degree of output from area CA1. 1) In conditions where activity projected
	to area CA1 produces only very low principal cell recruitment the
	local population rhythm mimics the gamma rhythm projected from CA3.
	This activity is generated predominantly by recruitment of CA1 basket
	cells in a manner dependent on phasic, feedforward excitation of
	this interneuron subclass. Interneurons in stratum oriens, not receiving
	CA3 feedforward input, fired at theta frequencies. 2) In the presence
	of serotonin CA1 principal cell recruitment was appreciably enhanced,
	resulting in dual activation of CA1 basket cells through both feedforward
	and feedback excitations. Feedback excitation to CA1 stratum oriens
	interneurons was also enhanced. The resulting change in interneuron
	network dynamics generated a beta-frequency CA1 rhythm (as a near-subharmonic
	of the gamma rhythm projected from CA3). These findings demonstrate
	that in nonreciprocally connected networks, the frequency of population
	rhythms in target areas serves to code for degree of principal cell
	recruitment by afferent input.},

	interruptus) stomatogastric ganglion. The sensitivity of synapses
	from most classes of identified neurons was examined. Blockade was
	at least partly reversible with prolonged washing. 2. The synapses
	from pyloric dilator (PD) neurons were the only inhibitory synapses
	that picrotoxin failed to block completely. 3. A correlation is derived
	that brief, fast-rise inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)
	are picrotoxin sensitive, whereas a slow rounded component of IPSPs
	from PD neurons is not picrotoxin sensitive. 4. Picrotoxin caused
	specific changes in the pattern of the motor rhythm produced by the
	16-cell pyloric network. This sheds some light on the functional
	role of particular synapses in the pyloric generator. 5. The endogenously
	bursting neurons (PD and anterior burster (AB)), which drive the
	pyloric rhythm, kept a similar burst rate. 6. Under picrotoxin, the
	pyloric "follower" neurons all moved to later phase relative to the
	"driver" group. Some normally antagonistic cells, related by reciprocal
	inhibitor connections, became in-phase. These and other pattern changes
	could be related to blockade of particular synapses. 7. The pyloric
	rhythm was still quite recognizable under picrotoxin despite the
	drastically altered circuitry of the synaptic network. This supports
	the idea that periodic inhibition from the PD driver neurons plays
	a primary role in creating the pyloric pattern.},

	This model has three fundamental properties that seem to exist in

	plasticity, which allows the network to learn to recognise temporal
	patterns; c) above all a large interconnection, which allows this
	network to recognise intervals of various duration. This model thus
	appears suited to identify combinations of temporal patterns in the
	dendrites of Kenyon cells (the principal cells in the calyces of
	the mushroom bodies). Moreover, the mushroom bodies integrate multimodal
	inputs, suggesting that the detection of temporal patterns may be

  abstract = {Alterations of basal ganglia physiology in parkinsonism may consist
	of two elements, an increase in the firing rate of neurones and a
	change in the pattern of synchronisation of discharges between neurones.
	Recent findings suggest the presence of two principal modes of synchronised
	activity within the human subthalamo-pallidal-thalamo-cortical circuit,
	at <30 Hz and >60 Hz. These oscillations are dynamically and systematically
	modulated by task, thereby suggesting a functional role in movement.
	More importantly, the two frequency modes are inversely affected
	by movement, consistent with opposing actions, and differentially
	expressed according to the prevailing level of dopaminergic activity.
	It is argued that the balance between these modes determines the
	effects of basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections on the motor
	areas of the cortex. The lower frequency oscillations facilitate
	slow idling rhythms in the motor areas of the cortex, whereas synchronisation
	at high frequency restores dynamic task-related cortical ensemble
	activity in the gamma band.},

  abstract = {Irregular intrinsic behavior of neurons seems ubiquitous in the nervous
	system. Even in circuits specialized to provide periodic and reliable
	patterns to control the repetitive activity of muscles, such as the
	pyloric central pattern generator (CPG) of the crustacean stomatogastric
	ganglion (STG), many bursting motor neurons present irregular activity
	when deprived from synaptic inputs. Moreover, many authors attribute
	to these irregularities the role of providing flexibility and adaptation
	capabilities to oscillatory neural networks such as CPGs. These irregular
	behaviors, related to nonlinear and chaotic properties of the cells,
	pose serious challenges to developing deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley-type
	(HH-type) conductance models. Only a few deterministic HH-type models
	based on experimental conductance values were able to show such nonlinear
	properties, but most of these models are based on slow oscillatory
	dynamics of the cytosolic calcium concentration that were never found
	experimentally in STG neurons. Based on an up-to-date single-compartment
	deterministic HH-type model of a STG neuron, we developed a stochastic
	HH-type model based on the microscopic Markovian states that an ion
	channel can achieve. We used tools from nonlinear analysis to show
	that the stochastic model is able to express the same kind of irregularities,
	sensitivity to initial conditions, and low dimensional dynamics found
	in the neurons isolated from the STG. Without including any nonrealistic
	dynamics in our whole cell stochastic model, we show that the nontrivial
	dynamics of the membrane potential naturally emerge from the interplay
	between the microscopic probabilistic character of the ion channels
	and the nonlinear interactions among these elements. Moreover, the
	experimental irregular behavior is reproduced by the stochastic model
	for the same parameters for which the membrane potential of the original
	deterministic model exhibits periodic oscillations.},

	manner, and in similar proportions ( 40\%) to cells exhibiting electrophysiologically
	recorded place fields under similar conditions. Theoretical accounts
	of the function of the fascia dentata suggest that it plays a role
	in pattern separation during encoding. The hypothesis that the dentate
	gyrus (DG) uses a sparse, and thus more orthogonal, coding scheme
	has been supported by the observation that, while granule cells do
	exhibit place fields, most are silent in a given environment. To
	quantify the degree of sparsity of DG coding and its corresponding
	ability to generate distinct environmental representations, behaviorally
	induced Arc expression was assessed using in situ hybridization coupled
	with confocal microscopy. The proportion of Arc(+) cells in the "upper
	blade" of the fascia dentata (i.e., the portion that abuts CA1) increased
	in an environment-specific fashion, approximately 4-fold above cage-control
	activity, after behavioral exploration. Surprisingly, cells in the
	lower blade of the fascia dentata, which are capable of expressing
	Arc following electrical stimulation, exhibited virtually no behaviorally-induced
	Arc expression. This difference was confirmed using "line scan" analyses,
	which also revealed no patterns or gradients of activity along the
	upper blade of the DG. The expression of Arc in the upper blade was
	quantitatively similar after exploring familiar or novel environments.
	When animals explored two different environments, separated by 20
	min, a new group of cells responded to the second environment, whereas
	two separated experiences in the same environment did not activate
	a new set of granular cells. Thus, granule cells generate distinct
	codes for different environments. These findings suggest differential
	contribution of upper and lower blade neurons to plastic networks
	and confirm the hypothesis that the DG uses sparse coding that may
	facilitate orthogonalization of information.},

	Models serve as proofs of concept, tests of sufficiency, and as quantitative
	embodiments of working hypotheses and are important tools for understanding
	and interpreting complex data sets. In the olfactory system, models
	have played a particularly prominent role in framing contemporary
	theories and presenting novel hypotheses, a role that will only grow
	as the complexity and intricacy of experimental data continue to
	increase. This review will attempt to provide a comprehensive, functional
	overview of computational ideas in olfaction and outline a computational
	framework for olfactory processing based on the insights provided
	by these diverse models and their supporting data.},

  abstract = {Rhythmic activity within the heartbeat pattern generator of the medicinal
	leech is based on the alternating bursting of mutually inhibitory
	pairs of oscillator heart interneurons (half-center oscillators).
	Bicuculline methiodide has been shown to block mutual inhibition
	between these interneurons and to cause them to spike tonically while
	recorded intracellularly (Schmidt and Calabrese, 1992). Using extracellular
	recording techniques, we show here that oscillator and premotor heart
	interneurons continue to burst when pharmacologically isolated with
	bicuculline, although the bursting is not robust in some preparations.
	We propose that a nonspecific leak current introduced by the intracellular
	microelectrode suppresses endogenous bursting activity to account
	for the discrepancy with results using intracellular recording. A
	two-parameter bifurcation diagram (E(leak) vs g(leak)) of a mathematical
	model of a single heart interneuron shows a narrow stripe of parameter
	values where bursting occurs, separating large zones of tonic spiking
	and silence. A similar analysis performed for a half-center oscillator
	model outlined a much larger area of bursting. Bursting in the half-center
	oscillator model is also less sensitive to variation in the maximal
	conductances of voltage-gated currents than in the single-neuron
	model. Thus, in addition to ensuring appropriate bursting characteristics
	such as period, phase, and duty cycles, the half-center configuration
	enhances oscillation robustness, making them less susceptible to
	random or imposed changes in membrane parameters. Endogenous bursting,
	in turn, ensures appropriate bursting if the strength of mutual inhibition
	is weakened and limits the minimum period of the half-center oscillator
	to a period near that of the single neuron.},

  abstract = {1. Most studies of cortical neurons have focused on the spatial structure
	of receptive fields. For a more complete functional description of
	these neurons, it is necessary to consider receptive-field structure
	in the joint domain of space and time. We have studied the spatiotemporal
	receptive-field structure of 233 simple cells recorded from the striate
	cortex of adult cats and kittens at 4 and 8 wk postnatal. The dual
	goal of this study is to provide a detailed quantitative description
	of spatiotemporal receptive-field structure and to compare the developmental
	time courses of spatial and temporal response properties. 2. Spatiotemporal
	receptive-field profiles have been measured with the use of a reverse
	correlation method, in which we compute the cross-correlation between
	a neuron's response and a random sequence of small, briefly presented
	bright and dark stimuli. The receptive-field profiles of some simple
	cells are space-time separable, meaning that spatial and temporal
	response characteristics can be dissociated. Other cells have receptive-field
	profiles that are space-time inseparable. In these cases, a particular
	spatial location cannot be designated, unambiguously, as belonging
	to either an on or off subregion. However, separate on and off subregions
	may be clearly distinguished in the joint space-time domain. These
	subregions are generally tilted along an oblique axis. 3. Our observations
	show that spatial and temporal aspects of receptive-field structure
	mature with clearly different time courses. By 4 wk postnatal, the
	spatial symmetry and periodicity of simple-cell receptive fields
	have reached maturity. The spatial extent (or size) of these receptive
	fields is adult-like by 8 wk postnatal. In contrast, the response
	latency and time duration of spatiotemporal receptive fields do not
	mature until well beyond 8 wk postnatal. 4. By applying Fourier analysis
	to spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles, we have examined the
	postnatal development of spatial and temporal selectivity in the
	frequency domain. By 8 wk postnatal, spatial frequency tuning has
	clearly reached maturity. On the contrary, temporal frequency selectivity
	remains markedly immature at 8 wk. We have also examined the joint
	distribution of optimal spatial and temporal frequencies. From 4
	wk postnatal until 8 wk postnatal, the range of optimal spatial frequencies
	increases substantially, whereas the range of optimal temporal frequencies
	remains largely unchanged. From 8 wk postnatal until adulthood, there
	is a large increase in optimal temporal frequencies for cells tuned
	to low spatial frequencies. For cells tuned to high spatial frequencies,
	the distribution of optimal temporal frequencies does not change
	much beyond 8 wk postnatal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Localization of the reporter with somatostatin and parvalbumin suggested

	were common among cortical interneurons in controls but were nearly
	absent in knockouts. A metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist excited

	critical for the generation of widespread, synchronous inhibitory

	of cortical neurons while monkeys performed tasks that required coordination
	between the two arms. We found that most neurons in the primary motor
	cortex (MI) show activity specific to bimanual movements (bimanual-related
	activity), which is strikingly different from the activity of the
	same neurons during unimanual movements. Moreover, units in the supplementary
	motor area (SMA; the area of cortex most often associated with bimanual
	coordination) showed no more bimanual-related activity than units
	in MI. Our results challenge the classic view that MI controls the
	contralateral (opposite) side of the body and that SMA is responsible
	for the coordination of the arms. Rather, our data suggest that both
	cortical areas share the control of bilateral coordination.},

	Studies of patients with localized brain damage and work in rodent

	in olfactory associative learning. We have used a temperature-sensitive
	dynamin transgene, which disrupts synaptic transmission reversibly

	for ongoing neural activity during memory formation. Here we show
	that synaptic transmission from mushroom body neurons is required

  abstract = {1. We explore the roles of conductances in Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models
	using a method that allows the explicit linking of HH model input-output
	behavior to parameter values for maximal conductances, voltage shifts,
	and time constants. The procedure can be used to identify not only
	the parameter values most critical to supporting a neuronal activity
	pattern of interest but also the relationships between parameters
	which may be required, e.g., limited ranges of relative magnitudes.
	2. The method is the repeated use of stochastic search to find hundreds
	or even thousands of different sets of model parameter values that
	allow a HH model to produce a desired behavior, such as current-frequency
	transduction, to within a desired tolerance, e.g., frequency match
	to within 10 Hz. Graphical or other analysis may then be performed
	to reveal the shape and boundaries of the parameter solution regions
	that support the desired behavior. 3. The shape of these parameter
	regions can reveal parameter values and relationships essential to
	the behavior. For instance, graphical display may reveal covariances
	between maximal conductance values, or a much wider range of variation
	in some maximal conductance values than in others. 4. We demonstrate
	the use of these techniques with simple, representative HH models,
	primarily that of Connor et al. for crustacean walking leg axons,
	but also some extensions of the results are explored using the more
	complex model of McCormick and Huguenard for thalamocortical relay
	neurons. Both models are single compartment. Behaviors studied include
	current-to-frequency transduction, the time delay to first action
	potential in response to current steps, and the timing of action
	potential occurrences in response to both square-wave current injection
	and the injection of currents derived from in vitro records of excitatory
	postsynaptic currents. 5. Using these simple models, we find that
	relatively general behaviors such as current-frequency (I/F) curves
	may be supported by very broad, but bounded parameter solution regions,
	with the shape of the solution regions revealing the relative importance
	of the maximal conductances of a model in creating the behavior.
	Furthermore, we find that a focus on increasingly specific behaviors,
	such as I/F behavior, defined by tolerances of only a few hertz combined
	with strict requirements for action potential height, inevitably
	leads to increasingly narrow, and eventually nonphysiologically narrow,
	regions of acceptable parameter values. 6. We use the Connor et al.
	model to reproduce the in vitro action potential timing responses
	of a rat brain stem neuron to various stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

	is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal
	groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations
	that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently
	oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their
	communication windows for input and for output are open at the same
	times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication
	structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.},

  abstract = {Activated neuronal groups typically engage in rhythmic synchronization
	in the gamma-frequency range (30-100 Hz). Experimental and modeling
	studies demonstrate that each gamma cycle is framed by synchronized
	spiking of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we review evidence suggesting
	that the resulting rhythmic network inhibition interacts with excitatory
	input to pyramidal cells such that the more excited cells fire earlier
	in the gamma cycle. Thus, the amplitude of excitatory drive is recoded
	into phase values of discharges relative to the gamma cycle. This
	recoding enables transmission and read out of amplitude information
	within a single gamma cycle without requiring rate integration. Furthermore,
	variation of phase relations can be exploited to facilitate or inhibit
	exchange of information between oscillating cell assemblies. The
	gamma cycle could thus serve as a fundamental computational mechanism
	for the implementation of a temporal coding scheme that enables fast
	processing and flexible routing of activity, supporting fast selection
	and binding of distributed responses. This review is part of the

	by activity, in a way that depends on the timing of neuronal firing
	on either side of the synapse. This spike-timing-dependent plasticity
	(STDP) has been studied by systematically varying the intervals between
	pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Here we studied how STDP operates in
	the context of more natural spike trains. We found that in visual
	cortical slices the contribution of each pre-/postsynaptic spike
	pair to synaptic modification depends not only on the interval between
	the pair, but also on the timing of preceding spikes. The efficacy
	of each spike in synaptic modification was suppressed by the preceding
	spike in the same neuron, occurring within several tens of milliseconds.
	The direction and magnitude of synaptic modifications induced by
	spike patterns recorded in vivo in response to natural visual stimuli
	were well predicted by incorporating the suppressive inter-spike
	interaction within each neuron. Thus, activity-induced synaptic modification
	depends not only on the relative spike timing between the neurons,
	but also on the spiking pattern within each neuron. For natural spike
	trains, the timing of the first spike in each burst is dominant in
	synaptic modification.},

  abstract = {Long-term synaptic modification depends on the relative timing of
	individual pre- and postsynaptic spikes, but the rules governing
	the effects of multispike bursts remain to be fully understood. In
	particular, some studies suggest that the spike timing dependence
	of synaptic modification breaks down with high-frequency bursts.
	In this study, we characterized the effects of pre- and postsynaptic
	bursts on long-term modification of layer 2/3 synapses in visual
	cortical slices from young rats. We found that, while pairing-induced
	synaptic modification depends on the burst frequency, this dependence
	can be explained in terms of the timing of individual pre- and postsynaptic
	spikes. Later spikes in each burst are less effective in synaptic
	modification, but spike efficacy is regulated differently in pre-
	and postsynaptic bursts. Presynaptically, spike efficacy is progressively
	weakened, in parallel with short-term synaptic depression. Postsynaptically,
	spike efficacy is suppressed to a lesser extent, and it depends on
	postsynaptic potassium channel activation. Such timing-dependent
	interaction among multiple spikes can account for synaptic modifications
	induced by a variety of spike trains, including the frequency-dependent
	transition from depression to potentiation induced by a postsynaptic

	connected neural network, or spin glass model, that spontaneously
	produces a hexagonal grid of activity bumps on a two-dimensional
	sheet of units. The spatial firing fields of the simulated cells
	closely resemble those of dMEC cells. A collection of grids with
	different scales and/or orientations forms a basis set for encoding
	position. Simulations show that the animal's location can easily
	be determined from the population activity pattern. Introducing an
	asymmetry in the model allows the activity bumps to be shifted in
	any direction, at a rate proportional to velocity, to achieve path
	integration. Furthermore, information about the structure of the
	environment can be superimposed on the spatial position signal by
	modulation of the bump activity levels without significantly interfering
	with the hexagonal periodicity of firing fields. Our results support
	the conjecture of Hafting et al. (2005) that an attractor network

  abstract = {The wake-sleep cycle, a spontaneous succession of global brain states
	that correspond to major overt behaviors, occurs in all higher vertebrates.
	The transitions between these states, at once rapid and drastic,
	remain poorly understood. Here, intracranial local field potentials
	(LFPs) recorded in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus
	were used to characterize the neurophysiological correlates of the
	rat wake-sleep cycle. By way of a new method for the objective classification
	and quantitative investigation of all major brain states, we demonstrate
	that global brain state transitions occur simultaneously across multiple
	forebrain areas as specific spectral trajectories with characteristic
	path, duration, and coherence bandwidth. During state transitions,
	striking changes in neural synchronization are effected by the prominent
	narrow-band LFP oscillations that mark state boundaries. Our results
	demonstrate that distant forebrain areas tightly coordinate the processing
	of neural information during and between global brain states, indicating
	a very high degree of functional integration across the entire wake-sleep
	cycle. We propose that transient oscillatory synchronization of synaptic
	inputs, which underlie the rapid switching of global brain states,
	may facilitate the exchange of information within and across brain
	areas at the boundaries of very distinct neural processing regimens.},

  abstract = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust
	in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the
	same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We
	find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global
	analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We
	vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and,
	for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern
	generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within
	the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model,
	we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances,
	along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change.
	In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few
	conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns.
	The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators
	that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and
	possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have
	no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change
	the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence.
	Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies
	are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion
	neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

	a neuromodulatory peptide that acts directly on the LP neuron, was
	modeled. The effect of the proctolin-activated current (iproc) on
	the model neuron mimics the effects of proctolin on the isolated
	biological LP neuron. The depolarization and increased frequency

	in the relative contributions of the delayed rectifier (id) and the
	Ca(2+)-activated outward current (io(Ca] to the repolarization phase

	(iA) in the model were compared with those obtained by pharmacologically
	blocking iA in the biological neuron. iA appears to regulate action-potential
	frequency as well as postinhibitory rebound activity. 4. The role
	of iA on the rhythmic activity of the cell was studied by modifying
	several of its parameters while periodically activating a simulated
	synaptically activated conductance, isyn. 5. The effects of manipulations

	Lesion and functional imaging studies have identified frontal, temporal,

	for determining ion channel kinetic mechanisms is single-channel
	recording and analysis. Yet, the limitations and complexities in
	interpreting single-channel recordings discourage many physiologists

	combination with a gradient descent algorithm can be used to fit
	whole-cell voltage-clamp data to kinetic models with a high degree
	of accuracy. Previously, ion channel stimulation traces were analyzed
	one at a time, the results of these analyses being combined to produce
	a picture of channel kinetics. Here the entire set of traces from
	all stimulation protocols are analysed simultaneously. The algorithm
	was initially tested on simulated current traces produced by several
	Hodgkin-Huxley-like and Markov chain models of voltage-gated potassium
	and sodium channels. Currents were also produced by simulating levels
	of noise expected from actual patch recordings. Finally, the algorithm
	was used for finding the kinetic parameters of several voltage-gated
	sodium and potassium channels models by matching its results to data
	recorded from layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the rat cortex in the
	nucleated outside-out patch configuration. The minimization scheme
	gives electrophysiologists a tool for reproducing and simulating

  abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role
	in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters,
	and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model
	development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is
	difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data
	often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier
	work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective
	fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left
	individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that
	the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with
	eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we
	use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such
	sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find
	that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities.
	We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building
	predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective
	fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave
	many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection
	are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective
	fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness
	also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and
	complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm
	this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results
	suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems
	biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power
	of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions
	rather than on parameters.},

  abstract = {Insects are favorable subjects for neuroethological studies. Their
	nervous systems are relatively small and contain many individually
	identifiable cells. The CNS is highly compartmentalized with clear
	separations between multisensory higher order neuropiles in the brain
	and neuropiles serving sensory-motor routines in the ventral cord
	(Huber, 1974). The rich behavior of insects includes orientation
	in space and time, visual, chemical, and mechanical communication,
	and complex motor routines for flying, walking, swimming, nest building,
	defense, and attack. Learning and memory, though, are not usually
	considered to be a strong point of insects. Rather, insect behavior
	is often regarded as highly stereotyped and under tight control of
	genetically programmed neural circuits. This view, however, does
	not do justice to the insect order of Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants).
	Most Hymenopteran species care for their brood either as individual
	females or as a social group of females. Consequently, they regularly
	return to their nest site to feed, protect, and nurse the larvae,
	store food, and hide from adverse environmental conditions. Since
	they search for food (prey; nectar and pollen on flowers) at unpredictable
	sites, they have to learn the celestial and terrestrial cues that
	guide their foraging trips over long distances and allow them to
	find their nest sites (central place foraging; von Frisch, 1967;
	Seeley, 1985). They learn to relate the sun's position and sky pattern
	of polarized light to the time of the day (Lindauer, 1959), and landmarks
	are learned in relationship to the nest site within the framework
	of the time-compensated sun compass. The honeybee communicates direction
	and distance of a feeding place to hive mates by performing a ritualized
	body movement, the waggle dance (von Frisch, 1967). Associative learning
	is an essential component of the bee's central place foraging behavior
	and dance communication. Hive mates attending a dance performance
	learn the odor emanating from the dancing bee and seek it at the
	indicated food site. The odor, color, and shape of flowers are learned
	when the bee experiences these stimuli shortly before it finds food
	(nectar, pollen). This appetitive learning in bees has many characteristics
	of associative learning well known from mammalian learning studies
	(Menzel, 1985, 1990; Bitterman, 1988). It follows the rules of classical
	and operant conditioning, respectively, so that stimuli or behavioral
	acts are associated with evaluating stimuli. Since associative learning,
	especially of the classical type, is well described at the phenomenological
	and operational level (Rescorla, 1988), it provides a favorable approach
	in the search for the neural substrate underlying learning and memory.(ABSTRACT

	its pathologic synaptic connections and reestablishes a physiological

	rat medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons during 'vestibular compensation',
	the behavioral recovery that follows damage to the vestibular receptors
	or nerve of one inner ear. Ipsi-lesional MVN neurons develop a significant
	increase in their intrinsic excitability, and a marked decrease in
	the functional efficacy of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, within
	4 h of unilateral vestibular deafferentation. These mechanisms presumably
	counteract the disfacilitation and excessive commissural inhibition
	of the ipsi-lesional cells after deafferentation, and thus promote
	the recovery of resting activity. In this study, we investigated
	the intrinsic membrane properties and spike firing characteristics
	of rostral ipsi-lesional MVN neurons in slices from animals that
	underwent vestibular compensation for either 24-72 h or 7-10 days.
	Significant changes were observed in the spontaneous in vitro discharge
	rate, resting membrane potentials and voltage-activated membrane
	conductances of type B cells, but not type A cells. There was a significant
	increase in the number of type B(LTS) cells compared to normal. These
	findings indicate that during vestibular compensation marked changes
	occur in ion channel expression and function selectively in type
	B MVN neurons. These changes are appropriate to increase the responsiveness
	of type B cells both to their own intrinsic pacemaker-like membrane
	conductances and excitatory synaptic inputs. Together with the downregulation
	of inhibitory receptor efficacy, this increased intrinsic excitability
	may be sufficient to restore the resting discharge of the deafferented
	neurons in vivo. These results therefore provide further evidence
	for synaptic and neuronal plasticity in ipsi-lesional MVN neurons
	during vestibular compensation.},

	(Hb9 INs) can generate locomotor-like rhythms in the newborn mouse
	spinal cord (Hinckley et al., 2005b). Processes of Hb9 INs are in
	close apposition to adjacent Hb9 INs, raising the possibility that
	the interneurons are synaptically interconnected. To test this hypothesis,
	whole-cell paired recordings were performed from visually identified
	Hb9 INs. High-incidence bidirectional electrical coupling was evident
	between Hb9 INs in spinal cords of newborn and juvenile mice. The
	coupling strength varied from 2 to 32\% with an average of 12\%.
	Our data suggested that the variability was not correlated with the
	distribution of electrical synapses at different electronic distances.
	Electrical synapses behaved as low-pass filters, reducing currents
	passing at frequencies >3 Hz. Episodes of spontaneous bursts of EPSCs
	were synchronous in coupled Hb9 INs, indicating that common synaptic
	inputs coordinated their activity. However, non-NMDA receptor-mediated
	synaptic transmission was not required to synchronize neurochemically
	induced membrane oscillations between electrically coupled interneurons.
	The finding that electrical transmission persists in mice that can
	walk is indicative of its importance in coordinating the activity
	of this neuronal population in functionally mature spinal networks.},

	limit cycle and in the other all phase paths approach a stable equilibrium

	pulse will change an initially silent model neuron into one that
	fires repetitively. Addition of a third equation limits this firing
	to either an isolated burst or a depolarizing afterpotential. When
	steady depolarizing current was applied to this model it resulted
	in periodic bursting. The equations, which were initially developed
	to explain isolated triggered bursts, therefore provide one of the

	Typically, CNNs can be implemented using VLSI circuits, but this

	In detail, we carefully organize the CNN data as 4-channel textures,

	have not been observed in the mammalian cortex during neuronal activity.
	Here, we report stable rotating spiral waves in rat neocortical slices
	visualized by voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Tissue from the occipital
	cortex (visual) was sectioned parallel to cortical lamina to preserve
	horizontal connections in layers III-V (500-mum-thick, approximately
	4 x 6 mm(2)). In such tangential slices, excitation waves propagated
	in two dimensions during cholinergic oscillations. Spiral waves occurred
	spontaneously and alternated with plane, ring, and irregular waves.
	The rotation rate of the spirals was approximately 10 turns per second,
	and the rotation was linked to the oscillations in a one-cycle- one-rotation
	manner. A small (<128 mum) phase singularity occurred at the center
	of the spirals, about which were observed oscillations of widely
	distributed phases. The phase singularity drifted slowly across the
	tissue ( approximately 1 mm/10 turns). We introduced a computational
	model of a cortical layer that predicted and replicated many of the
	features of our experimental findings. We speculate that rotating
	spiral waves may provide a spatial framework to organize cortical
	oscillations.},

  abstract = {Systematic mapping studies involving 365 odorant chemicals have shown
	that glomerular responses in the rat olfactory bulb are organized
	spatially in patterns that are related to the chemistry of the odorant
	stimuli. This organization involves the spatial clustering of principal
	responses to numerous odorants that share key aspects of chemistry
	such as functional groups, hydrocarbon structural elements, and/or
	overall molecular properties related to water solubility. In several
	of the clusters, responses shift progressively in position according
	to odorant carbon chain length. These response domains appear to
	be constructed from orderly projections of sensory neurons in the
	olfactory epithelium and may also involve chromatography across the
	nasal mucosa. The spatial clustering of glomerular responses may
	serve to "tune" the principal responses of bulbar projection neurons
	by way of inhibitory interneuronal networks, allowing the projection
	neurons to respond to a narrower range of stimuli than their associated
	sensory neurons. When glomerular activity patterns are viewed relative
	to the overall level of glomerular activation, the patterns accurately
	predict the perception of odor quality, thereby supporting the notion
	that spatial patterns of activity are the key factors underlying
	that aspect of the olfactory code. A critical analysis suggests that
	alternative coding mechanisms for odor quality, such as those based
	on temporal patterns of responses, enjoy little experimental support.},

  abstract = {Graded chemical synaptic transmission is important for establishing
	the motor patterns produced by the pyloric central pattern generator
	(CPG) circuit of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion (Raper, 1979;
	Anderson and Barker, 1981; Graubard et al., 1983). We examined the
	modulatory effects of the amines dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT),
	and octopamine (Oct) on graded synaptic transmission at all the central
	chemical synapses made by the pyloric dilator (PD) neuron onto its
	follower cells, using synaptic input-output curves measured from
	cell somata. DA strongly reduced the graded synaptic strength at
	all the PD synapses. DA reduction of chemical synaptic strength from
	PD onto the inferior cardiac (IC) neuron could change the sign of
	synaptic interaction between these 2 cells from inhibitory to excitatory
	by uncovering a weak electrical connection. 5-HT had weaker and more
	variable effects, reducing graded synaptic strength from the PD onto
	the lateral pyloric and pyloric neurons and enhancing the weak synapse
	from the PD to the IC cell. Oct strongly enhanced the graded synaptic
	strength at all the PD central synapses. Oct enhancement of graded
	synaptic strength between the PD and IC cells could also change the
	sign of the interaction: weak, excitatory electrical coupling, which
	was sometimes dominant before Oct, was masked by the enhanced chemical
	inhibitory interaction during Oct application. Measurements of electrical
	coupling between 2 PD cells and between 2 postsynaptic cells suggest
	that Oct does not change the input resistance of these cells and
	may act directly at the PD synapses. The effects of DA and 5-HT are
	most easily explained by their general reductions in pre- and postsynaptic
	input resistance. DA, 5-HT, and Oct each produce a distinct pyloric
	motor pattern (Flamm and Harris-Warrick, 1986a). These amine-induced
	motor patterns may be explained by the unique actions of each amine
	on the intrinsic membrane properties of different pyloric CPG neurons
	(Flamm and Harris-Warrick, 1986b) and by modulation of graded synaptic
	transmission between the pyloric neurons.},

  abstract = {1. Using the two-dimensional (2D) spatial and spectral response profiles
	described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization
	of Marcelja's hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a
	class of linear spatial filters analogous to those described by Gabor
	and referred to here as 2D Gabor filters. 2. In the space domain,
	we found 2D Gabor filters that fit the 2D spatial response profile
	of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex
	algorithm), and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial
	structure and statistically indistinguishable from random error.
	3. Although a rigorous statistical approach was not possible with
	our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit the 2D
	spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the
	residual errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay
	of spatial linearity in two dimensions, on which the applicability
	of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare the filter parameters estimated
	from the independent 2D spatial and spectral measurements described
	above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly
	correlated, indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are
	valid. 5. Finally, we show that the functional form of the 2D Gabor
	filter provides a concise mathematical expression, which incorporates
	the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive fields
	demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian
	separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields
	with staggered subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral
	response profiles, 4) spectral response profiles with axes of symmetry
	not including the origin, and 5) the uniform distribution of spatial
	phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides a useful
	and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple
	receptive fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved
	for sampling images simultaneously in the 2D spatial and spatial
	frequency domains.},

	Sparse representations present many advantages for memory storage

	the statistics of connectivity in an olfactory network that contributes
	to the generation of such codes: Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic
	neurons of the mushroom body (a structure involved in learning and
	memory in insects) receive inputs from a small population of broadly
	tuned principal neurons; from these inputs, KCs generate exquisitely
	selective responses and, thus, sparse representations. We find, surprisingly,
	that KCs are on average each connected to about 50\% of their input
	population. Simple analysis indicates that such connectivity indeed
	maximizes the difference between input vectors to KCs and helps to
	explain their high specificity.},

  abstract = {Compartmental models with many nonlinearly and nonhomogeneous distributions
	of voltage-gated conductances are routinely used to investigate the
	physiology of complex neurons. However, the number of loosely constrained
	parameters makes manually constructing the desired model a daunting
	if not impossible task. Recently, progress has been made using automated
	parameter search methods, such as genetic algorithms (GAs). However,
	these methods have been applied to somatically recorded action potentials
	using relatively simple target functions. Using a genetic minimization
	algorithm and a reduced compartmental model based on a previously
	published model of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons we compared
	the efficacy of five cost functions (based on the waveform of the
	membrane potential, the interspike interval, trajectory density,
	and their combinations) to constrain the model. When the model was
	constrained using somatic recordings only, a combined cost function
	was found to be the most effective. This combined cost function was
	then applied to investigate the contribution of dendritic and axonal
	recordings to the ability of the GA to constrain the model. The more
	recording locations from the dendrite and the axon that were added
	to the data set the better was the genetic minimization algorithm
	able to constrain the compartmental model. Based on these simulations
	we propose an experimental scheme that, in combination with a genetic
	minimization algorithm, may be used to constrain compartmental models
	of neurons.},

  abstract = {Electrical activity in identical neurons across individuals is often
	remarkably similar and stable over long periods. However, the ionic
	currents that determine the electrical activity of these neurons
	show wide animal-to-animal amplitude variability. This seemingly
	random variability of individual current amplitudes may obscure mechanisms
	that globally reduce variability and that contribute to the generation
	of similar neuronal output. One such mechanism could be the coordinated
	regulation of ionic current expression. Studying identified neurons
	of the Cancer borealis pyloric network, we discovered that the removal
	of neuromodulatory input to this network (decentralization) was accompanied
	by the loss of the coordinated regulation of ionic current levels.
	Additionally, decentralization induced large changes in the levels
	of several ionic currents. The loss of coregulation and the changes
	in current levels were prevented by continuous exogenous application
	of proctolin, an endogenous neuromodulatory peptide, to the pyloric
	network. This peptide does not exert fast regulatory actions on any
	of the currents affected by decentralization. We conclude that neuromodulatory
	inputs to the pyloric network have a novel role in the regulation
	of ionic current expression. They can control, over the long term,
	the coordinated expression of multiple voltage-gated ionic currents
	that they do not acutely modulate. Our results suggest that current
	coregulation places constraints on neuronal intrinsic plasticity
	and the ability of a network to respond to perturbations. The loss
	of conductance coregulation may be a mechanism to facilitate the
	recovery of function.},

	numbers of neurons, were observed first in the olfactory system and
	have since been described in many neocortical areas. The importance
	of these oscillations in information coding, however, is controversial.
	Here, local field potential and intracellular recordings were obtained
	from the antennal lobe and mushroom body of the locust Schistocerca
	americana. Different odors evoked coherent oscillations in different,
	but usually overlapping, ensembles of neurons. The phase of firing
	of individual neurons relative to the population was not dependent
	on the odor. The components of a coherently oscillating ensemble
	of neurons changed over the duration of a single exposure to an odor.
	It is thus proposed that odors are encoded by specific but dynamic
	assemblies of coherently oscillating neurons. Such distributed and
	temporal representation of complex sensory signals may facilitate
	combinatorial coding and associative learning in these, and possibly
	other, sensory networks.},

  abstract = {Kenyon cells are the intrinsic interneurons of the mushroom bodies
	in the insect brain, a center for olfactory and multimodal processing
	and associative learning. These neurons are small (3-8 microns soma
	diameter) and numerous (340,000 and 400,000 in the bee and cockroach
	brains, respectively). In Drosophila, Kenyon cells are the dominant
	site of expression of the dunce, DC0, and rutabaga gene products,
	enzymes in the cAMP cascade whose absence leads to specific defects
	in olfactory learning. In honeybees, the volume of the mushroom body
	neurophils may depend on the age or social status of the individual.
	Although the anatomy of these neurons has been known for nearly a
	century, their physiological properties and the principles of information
	processing in the circuits that they form are totally unknown. This
	article provides a first such characterization. The activity of Kenyon
	cells was recorded in vivo from locust brains with intracellular
	and local field potential electrodes during olfactory processing.
	Kenyon cells had a high input impedance (approximately 1 G omega
	at the soma). They produced action potentials upon depolarization,
	and consistently showed spike adaptation during long depolarizing
	current pulses. They generally displayed a low resting level of spike
	activity in the absence of sensory stimulation, despite a large background
	of spontaneous synaptic activity, and showed no intrinsic bursting
	behavior. Presentation of an airborne odor, but not air alone, to
	an antenna evoked spatially coherent field potential oscillations
	in the ipsilateral mushroom body, with a frequency of approximately
	20 Hz. The frequency of these oscillations was independent of the
	nature of the odorant. Short bouts of oscillations sometimes occurred
	spontaneously, that is, in the absence of odorant stimulation. Autocorrelograms
	of the local field potentials in the absence of olfactory stimulation
	revealed small peaks at +/- 50 msec, suggesting an intrinsic tendency
	of the mushroom body networks to oscillate at 20 Hz. Such oscillatory
	behavior could not be seen from local field potential recordings
	in the antennal lobes, and may thus be generated in the mushroom
	body, or via feedback interactions with downstream neurons in the
	protocerebrum. During the odor-induced oscillations, the membrane
	potential of Kenyon cells oscillated around the resting level, under
	the influence of excitatory inputs phase-locked to the field activity.
	Each phasic wave of depolarization in a Kenyon cell could be amplified
	by intrinsic excitable properties of the dendritic membrane, and
	sometimes led to one action potential, whose timing was phase-locked
	to the population oscillations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the insect olfactory system uses a
	spatio-temporal encoding of odours in the population of projection
	neurons in the antennal lobe, and suggest that the information thus
	coded is spread across a large population of Kenyon cells in the
	mushroom bodies. At this stage, the temporal part of the code might
	be transformed into a spatial code, especially via the temporally
	sensitive mechanisms of paired-pulse facilitation and feedback inhibition
	with its possible associated rebound. We explore here a simple model
	of the olfactory system using a three-layer network of formal neurons,
	comprising a fixed number (three) of projection and inhibitory neurons,
	but a variable number of Kenyon cells. We show how enlarging the
	divergence of the network (i.e. the ratio between the number of Kenyon
	cells to the number of input - projection - neurons) alters the number
	of different output spatial states in response to a fixed set of
	spatio-temporal inputs, and may therefore improve its effectiveness
	in discriminating between these inputs. Such enlarged divergence
	also reduces the variation of this effectiveness among random realizations
	of the network connectivity. Our model shows that the discriminative
	effectiveness first increases with the divergence, and then plateaus
	for a divergence factor of approximately 20. The maximal average
	number of different outputs was 470.2, which was computed from some
	simulations with random realizations of connectivity and with a set
	of 512 possible inputs. The discriminative effectiveness of the network
	is sensitive to paired-pulse facilitation, and especially to inhibition
	with rebound.},

	a new method (WSC) is presented to sort spikes according to a decomposition

	implemented by a pyramidal algorithm that acts upon neural signals
	as a bank of quadrature mirror filters. This algorithm is clearly
	explained and an overview of the mathematical background of wavelet
	analysis is given. An artificial spike train, especially designed
	to test the specificity and sensibility of sorting procedures, was
	used to assess the performance of the WSC method as well as of methods
	based on principal component analysis (PCA) and reduced feature set
	(RFS). The WSC method outperformed the other two methods. Its superior
	performance was largely due to the fact that spike profiles that
	could not be separated by previous methods (because of the similarity
	of their temporal profile and the masking action of noise) were separable
	by the WSC method. The WSC method is particularly noise resistant,
	as it implicitly eliminates the irrelevant information contained
	in the noise frequency range. But the main advantage of the WSC method
	is its use of parameters that describe the joint time-frequency localization
	of spike features to build a fast and unspecialized pattern recognition
	procedure.},

  abstract = {The world is permanently changing. Laboratory experiments on learning
	and memory normally minimize this feature of reality, keeping all
	conditions except the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli as constant
	as possible. In the real world, however, animals need to extract
	from the universe of sensory signals the actual predictors of salient
	events by separating them from non-predictive stimuli (context).
	In principle, this can be achieved if only those sensory inputs that
	resemble the reinforcer in their temporal structure are taken as
	predictors. Here we study visual learning in the fly Drosophila melanogaster,
	using a flight simulator, and show that memory retrieval is, indeed,
	partially context-independent. Moreover, we show that the mushroom
	bodies, which are required for olfactory but not visual or tactile
	learning, effectively support context generalization. In visual learning
	in Drosophila, it appears that a facilitating effect of context cues
	for memory retrieval is the default state, whereas making recall
	context-independent requires additional processing.},

	The application of an antagonist of ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric

	interneurons and in a conductance-based model of a pair of FS cells.
	Phase-response curves (PRCs) were obtained for real interneurons
	and the model cells. We used PRCs and the theory of weakly coupled
	oscillators to make predictions about phase-locking characteristics
	of cell pairs. Phase locking and the robustness of phase-locked states
	to differences in intrinsic frequencies of cells were directly examined
	by driving interneuron pairs through a wide range of firing frequencies.
	Calculations using PRCs accurately predicted that electrical coupling
	robustly synchronized the firing of interneurons over all frequencies
	studied (FS, approximately 25-80 Hz; LTS, approximately 10-30 Hz).
	The synchronizing ability of electrical coupling and the robustness
	of the phase-locked states were directly dependent on the strength
	of coupling but not on firing frequency. The FS cell model also predicted
	the existence of stable antiphase firing at frequencies below approximately
	30 Hz, but no evidence for stable antiphase firing was found using
	the experimentally determined PRCs or in direct measures of phase
	locking in pairs of interneurons. Despite significant differences
	in biophysical properties of FS and LTS cells, their phase-locking
	behavior was remarkably similar. The wide spikes and shallow action
	potential afterhyperpolarizations of interneurons, compared with
	the model, prohibited antiphase behavior. Electrical coupling between
	cortical interneurons of the same type maintained robust synchronous
	firing of cell pairs for up to approximately 10\% heterogeneity in
	their intrinsic frequencies.},

  abstract = {To determine general or species-specific properties in neural systems,
	it is necessary to use comparative data in evaluating experimental
	findings. Presented here are data on associative learning and memory
	formation in honeybees, emphasizing a comparative approach. We focus
	on four aspects: (1) the role of an identified neuron, VUM(mx1),
	as a neural substrate of appetitive reinforcement; (2) the sequences
	of molecular events as they correlate with five forms of memory stages;
	(3) the localization of the memory traces following appetitive olfactory
	learning; and (4) the brief description of several forms of complex
	learning in bees (configuration in olfactory conditioning, categorization
	in visual feature learning, delayed matching-to-sample learning,
	and latent learning in navigation). VUM(mx1) activity following the
	conditioned stimulus odor is sufficient to replace the unconditioned
	stimulus, and VUM(mx1) changes its response properties during learning
	similarly to what is known from dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia
	of the mammalian brain. The transition from short- to mid- and long-term
	forms of memory can be related to specific activation of second messenger
	cascades (involving NOS, PKA, PKC, and PKM) resembling general features
	of neural plasticity at the cellular level. The particular time course
	of the various memory traces may be adapted to the behavioral context
	in which they are used; here, the foraging cycle of the bee. Memory
	traces for even such a simple form of learning as olfactory conditioning
	are multiple and distributed, involving first- and second-order sensory
	neuropils (antennal lobe and mushroom bodies), but with distinctly
	different properties. The wealth of complex forms of learning in
	the context of foraging indicates basic cognitive capacities based
	on rule extraction and context-dependent learning. It is believed
	that bees might be a useful model for studying cognitive faculties
	at a middle level of complexity.},

  abstract = {1. In three preceding papers in this series (6, 33, 45), the functional
	roles, intrinsic cellular properties, and synaptic connections of
	identified neurons in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion were investigated
	using the dye-sensitized photoinactivation technique. In this paper,
	we investigate the network properties of the pyloric system. 2. The
	relative strengths of the synaptic interactions between all possible
	motor neuron pairs were measured from the neuronal cell bodies. 3.
	Experiments were performed to determine the minimal subset of the
	pyloric neurons that could generate rhythmic activity due to network
	interactions alone. With the endogenously bursting anterior burster
	(AB) cell excluded from consideration, the minimum number of elements
	was found to be two. These two elements behaved as a classical "half-center"
	oscillator when their overall activity levels were appropriately
	adjusted. 4. Two cells in the commissural ganglia supply the pyloric
	system with rhythmic excitatory input phase locked to ongoing pyloric
	activity. The rhythmicity of that input is shown to be functionally
	irrelevant. The inputs can exert their effects on pyloric system
	activity through tonic firing. 5. A qualitative explanation of three
	important aspects of the pyloric motor pattern is presented, based
	on the intrinsic properties of pyloric neurons and the systematic
	properties of the network they form. The existence of the pattern
	results from oscillatory membrane properties of the individual neurons
	in combination with the multiple reciprocally inhibitory interactions
	within the network. The phase relationships derive from the synaptic
	connectivity and depend on relative synaptic strengths, postinhibitory
	rebound, rebound delay, and the kinetics of the plateau and bursting
	pacemaker-potential generation mechanisms. The overall pattern frequency
	is determined by the AB interneuron via its intrinsic oscillatory
	behavior and strong synapses with the rest of the pyloric neurons.},

  abstract = {Organotypic cultures of the lobster (Homarus gammarus) stomatogastric
	nervous system (STNS) were used to assess changes in membrane properties
	of neurons of the pyloric motor pattern-generating network in the
	long-term absence of neuromodulatory inputs to the stomatogastric
	ganglion (STG). Specifically, we investigated decentralization-induced
	changes in the distribution and density of the transient outward
	current, I(A), which is encoded within the STG by the shal gene and
	plays an important role in shaping rhythmic bursting of pyloric neurons.
	Using an antibody against lobster shal K(+) channels, we found shal
	immunoreactivity in the membranes of neuritic processes, but not
	somata, of STG neurons in 5 d cultured STNS with intact modulatory
	inputs. However, in 5 d decentralized STG, shal immunoreactivity
	was still seen in primary neurites but was likewise present in a
	subset of STG somata. Among the neurons displaying this altered shal
	localization was the pyloric dilator (PD) neuron, which remained
	rhythmically active in 5 d decentralized STG. Two-electrode voltage
	clamp was used to compare I(A) in synaptically isolated PD neurons
	in long-term decentralized STG and nondecentralized controls. Although
	the voltage dependence and kinetics of I(A) changed little with decentralization,
	the maximal conductance of I(A) in PD neurons increased by 43.4\%.
	This increase was consistent with the decentralization-induced increase
	in shal protein expression, indicating an alteration in the density
	and distribution of functional A-channels. Our results suggest that,
	in addition to the short-term regulation of network function, modulatory
	inputs may also play a role, either directly or indirectly, in controlling
	channel number and distribution, thereby maintaining the biophysical
	character of neuronal targets on a long-term basis.},

	of dynamical systems theory. Why are neuronal systems different as
	a subject for synchronization? (1) Neurons in themselves are multidimensional
	nonlinear systems that are able to exhibit a wide variety of different
	activity patterns. Their "dynamical repertoire" includes regular
	or chaotic spiking, regular or chaotic bursting, multistability,
	and complex transient regimes. (2) Usually, neuronal oscillations
	are the result of the cooperative activity of many synaptically connected
	neurons (a neuronal circuit). Thus, it is necessary to consider synchronization
	between different neuronal circuits as well. (3) The synapses that
	implement the coupling between neurons are also dynamical elements
	and their intrinsic dynamics influences the process of synchronization
	or entrainment significantly. In this review we will focus on four
	new problems: (i) the synchronization in minimal neuronal networks
	with plastic synapses (synchronization with activity dependent coupling),
	(ii) synchronization of bursts that are generated by a group of nonsymmetrically
	coupled inhibitory neurons (heteroclinic synchronization), (iii)
	the coordination of activities of two coupled neuronal networks (partial
	synchronization of small composite structures), and (iv) coarse grained
	synchronization in larger systems (synchronization on a mesoscopic

	The implications for the corresponding range of suitable network,
	single neuron, and ion channel properties have remained elusive.
	In this article we approach the question of how well-constrained
	properties of neuronal systems may be on the neuronal level. We used
	large data sets of the activity of isolated invertebrate identified
	cells and built an accurate conductance-based model for this cell
	type using customized automated parameter estimation techniques.
	By direct inspection of the data we found that the variability of
	the neurons is larger when they are isolated from the circuit than
	when in the intact system. Furthermore, the responses of the neurons
	to perturbations appear to be more consistent than their autonomous
	behavior under stationary conditions. In the developed model, the
	constraints on different parameters that enforce appropriate model
	dynamics vary widely from some very tightly controlled parameters
	to others that are almost arbitrary. The model also allows predictions
	for the effect of blocking selected ionic currents and to prove that
	the origin of irregular dynamics in the neuron model is proper chaoticity
	and that this chaoticity is typical in an appropriate sense. Our
	results indicate that data driven models are useful tools for the
	in-depth analysis of neuronal dynamics. The better consistency of
	responses to perturbations, in the real neurons as well as in the
	model, suggests a paradigm shift away from measuring autonomous dynamics
	alone towards protocols of controlled perturbations. Our predictions
	for the impact of channel blockers on the neuronal dynamics and the
	proof of chaoticity underscore the wide scope of our approach.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of computer technology many novel uses of dynamic
	clamp have become possible. We have added new features to our dynamic
	clamp software StdpC ("Spike timing-dependent plasticity Clamp")
	allowing such new applications while conserving the ease of use and
	installation of the popular earlier Dynclamp 2/4 package. Here, we
	introduce the new features of a waveform generator, freely programmable
	Hodgkin-Huxley conductances, learning synapses, graphic data displays,
	and a powerful scripting mechanism and discuss examples of experiments
	using these features. In the first example we built and 'voltage
	clamped' a conductance based model cell from a passive resistor-capacitor
	(RC) circuit using the dynamic clamp software to generate the voltage-dependent
	currents. In the second example we coupled our new spike generator
	through a burst detection/burst generation mechanism in a phase-dependent
	way to a neuron in a central pattern generator and dissected the
	subtle interaction between neurons, which seems to implement an information
	transfer through intraburst spike patterns. In the third example,
	making use of the new plasticity mechanism for simulated synapses,
	we analyzed the effect of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
	on synchronization revealing considerable enhancement of the entrainment
	of a post-synaptic neuron by a periodic spike train. These examples
	illustrate that with modern dynamic clamp software like StdpC, the
	dynamic clamp has developed beyond the mere introduction of artificial
	synapses or ionic conductances into neurons to a universal research
	tool, which might well become a standard instrument of modern electrophysiology.},

	odor-evoked ORN input to just one glomerulus reveals that most PNs
	postsynaptic to other glomeruli receive indirect excitatory input
	from the single ORN type that is active. Lateral connections between
	identified glomeruli vary in strength, and this pattern of connections
	is stereotyped across flies. Thus, a dense network of lateral connections

	such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their
	relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms

	attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images

	will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive
	fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The

	responses to coincident EPSPs. Abolishing oscillatory synchronization
	weakens the preference of KCs for coincident input and causes a large

	the form of linear and circular traveling waves. Such waves may be
	a consequence of a pacemaker that emits periodic pulses of excitation
	that propagate across a network of excitable neuronal tissue or may
	result from continuous and possibly reconfigurable phase shifts along
	a network with multiple weakly coupled neuronal oscillators. As a
	means to resolve the origin of wave propagation in turtle visual
	cortex, we performed simultaneous measurements of the local field
	potential at a series of depths throughout this cortex. Measurements
	along a single radial penetration revealed the presence of broadband
	current sources, with a center frequency near 20 Hz (gamma band),
	that were activated by visual stimulation. The spectral coherence
	between sources at two well-separated loci along a rostral-caudal
	axis revealed the presence of systematic timing differences between
	localized cortical oscillators. These multiple oscillating current
	sources and their timing differences in a tangential plane are interpreted
	as the neuronal activity that underlies the wave motion revealed
	in previous imaging studies. The present data provide direct evidence
	for the inference from imaging of bidirectional wave motion that
	the stimulus-induced electrical waves in turtle visual cortex correspond
	to phase shifts in a network of coupled neuronal oscillators.},

  abstract = {The computations involved in the processing of a visual scene invariably
	involve the interactions among neurons throughout all of visual cortex.
	One hypothesis is that the timing of neuronal activity, as well as
	the amplitude of activity, provides a means to encode features of
	objects. The experimental data from studies on cat [Gray, C. M.,
	Konig, P., Engel, A. K. & Singer, W. (1989) Nature (London) 338,
	334-337] support a view in which only synchronous (no phase lags)
	activity carries information about the visual scene. In contrast,
	theoretical studies suggest, on the one hand, the utility of multiple
	phases within a population of neurons as a means to encode independent
	visual features and, on the other hand, the likely existence of timing
	differences solely on the basis of network dynamics. Here we use
	widefield imaging in conjunction with voltage-sensitive dyes to record
	electrical activity from the virtually intact, unanesthetized turtle
	brain. Our data consist of single-trial measurements. We analyze
	our data in the frequency domain to isolate coherent events that
	lie in different frequency bands. Low frequency oscillations (<5
	Hz) are seen in both ongoing activity and activity induced by visual
	stimuli. These oscillations propagate parallel to the afferent input.
	Higher frequency activity, with spectral peaks near 10 and 20 Hz,
	is seen solely in response to stimulation. This activity consists
	of plane waves and spiral-like waves, as well as more complex patterns.
	The plane waves have an average phase gradient of approximately pi/2
	radians/mm and propagate orthogonally to the low frequency waves.
	Our results show that large-scale differences in neuronal timing
	are present and persistent during visual processing.},

	coherence in terms of short-term potentiation and short-term depression

	such coordination, however, remain poorly understood. Song production
	in birds is a highly stereotyped learned motor behavior that requires
	finely tuned coordination between hemispheres. In the present study,
	neural activity was recorded simultaneously from the song control
	nucleus HVc in each hemisphere of singing adult male zebra finches
	(Taeniopygia guttata). In all cases, the pattern of recorded multiunit
	activity in each hemisphere was highly correlated during short segments

	of multiple short bursts of activity. Because of the absence of interhemispheric
	connections between song control nuclei, these observations suggest
	that HVc activity is "synchronized" by common inputs to both hemispheres.
	Using sliding-window cross-covariance analyses, periods of high interhemispheric
	synchronization were found to be time-locked to the acoustic onset
	of syllables and notes. In some cases, precisely synchronized bursts
	in both hemispheres were also observed during periods associated
	with the intersyllable silent interval. In all cases, activity was
	correlated between hemispheres independently of the recording site,
	suggesting that all regions of HVc may be globally synchronized during
	these short segments of the song. Given the anatomical organization
	of the song system, inputs originating from either thalamus or midbrain
	are proposed to act as timing signals that initiate and synchronize
	intrinsic motor networks within each HVc thus allowing for the precise
	coordination of motor commands across hemispheres.},

	network of vocal control nuclei that are present in both cerebral
	hemispheres. Unilateral lesions of song nuclei in the left or the
	right hemisphere result in different effects on song structure, suggesting
	that normal song output results from the activation of two parallel
	but functionally different motor pathways. Because each syringeal
	half is innervated primarily by ipsilateral motor structures and
	activity in both halves is tightly coordinated during singing, motor
	commands originating from both hemispheres must be tightly coordinated
	to produce the appropriate vocal output. This coordination occurs
	despite the absence of direct interhemispheric connections between
	song control nuclei. In this article, we discuss how motor commands
	in nucleus HVC, a key forebrain song control region, are coordinated
	by precisely timed inputs that act to synchronize premotor activity
	in both hemispheres. Synchronizing inputs are tightly linked to syllable
	and note onset, which suggests that bilaterally organized circuits
	in the midbrain or brainstem act in specifying higher-order song
	features, such as duration, order, and possibly even structure of
	individual song syllables. The challenge ahead lies in identifying
	the networks that generate the synchronizing timing inputs and to
	determine how these inputs specify the motor commands in HVC. Resolving
	these issues will help us gain a better understanding of how pattern-generating
	networks in the midbrain/brainstem interface with forebrain circuits
	to produce complex learned behaviors.},

	Thus, the neural circuits in their olfactory system are likely to

	process molecular representations and classify molecules. The three-step
	approach mimics neurocomputational principles observed in olfactory
	systems. In the first step, the original stimulus space is sampled
	by "virtual receptors," which are chemotopically arranged by a self-organizing
	map. In the second step, the signals from the virtual receptors are
	decorrelated via correlation-based lateral inhibition. Finally, in
	the third step, olfactory scent perception is modeled by a machine
	learning classifier. We found that signal decorrelation during the
	second stage significantly increases the accuracy of odorant classification.
	Moreover, our results suggest that the proposed signal transform
	is capable of dimensionality reduction and is more robust against
	overdetermined representations than principal component scores. Our

	bioactivities of pharmaceutically active compounds with high accuracy.

	while restrained in a harness that allows subjects to move their
	antennae and mouthparts (Kuwabara, 1957; Menzel, Erber, & Masuhr,
	1974). Subjects were conditioned to discriminate between two odors,
	one associated with sucrose feeding and the other associated with
	a 10 V AC shock if they responded to the sucrose unconditioned stimulus
	(US) in the context of that odor. Most Ss readily learned to respond
	to the odor followed by sucrose feeding and not to the odor associated

	of the odor associated with shock, significantly more subjects withheld
	or delayed proboscis extension on stimulation with the sucrose US
	than they did in the context of the odor associated with feeding.
	Thus, restrained honeybees can readily learn to avoid shock according
	to an odor context by withholding proboscis extension to a normally
	powerful releaser. Analysis of individual learning curves revealed
	that subjects differed markedly in performance on this task. Some
	learn the discrimination quickly, whereas others show different kinds

  abstract = {Electrical coupling between neurons with similar properties is often
	studied. Nonetheless, the role of electrical coupling between neurons
	with widely different intrinsic properties also occurs, but is less
	well understood. Inspired by the pacemaker group of the crustacean
	pyloric network, we developed a multicompartment, conductance-based
	model of a small network of intrinsically distinct, electrically
	coupled neurons. In the pyloric network, a small intrinsically bursting
	neuron, through gap junctions, drives 2 larger, tonically spiking
	neurons to reliably burst in-phase with it. Each model neuron has
	2 compartments, one responsible for spike generation and the other
	for producing a slow, large-amplitude oscillation. We illustrate
	how these compartments interact and determine the dynamics of the
	model neurons. Our model captures the dynamic oscillation range measured
	from the isolated and coupled biological neurons. At the network
	level, we explore the range of coupling strengths for which synchronous
	bursting oscillations are possible. The spatial segregation of ionic
	currents significantly enhances the ability of the 2 neurons to burst
	synchronously, and the oscillation range of the model pacemaker network
	depends not only on the strength of the electrical synapse but also
	on the identity of the neuron receiving inputs. We also compare the
	activity of the electrically coupled, distinct neurons with that
	of a network of coupled identical bursting neurons. For small to
	moderate coupling strengths, the network of identical elements, when
	receiving asymmetrical inputs, can have a smaller dynamic range of
	oscillation than that of its constituent neurons in isolation.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Since the discovery of small-world and scale-free networks
	the study of complex systems from a network perspective has taken
	an enormous flight. In recent years many important properties of
	complex networks have been delineated. In particular, significant
	progress has been made in understanding the relationship between
	the structural properties of networks and the nature of dynamics
	taking place on these networks. For instance, the 'synchronizability'
	of complex networks of coupled oscillators can be determined by graph
	spectral analysis. These developments in the theory of complex networks
	have inspired new applications in the field of neuroscience. Graph
	analysis has been used in the study of models of neural networks,
	anatomical connectivity, and functional connectivity based upon fMRI,
	EEG and MEG. These studies suggest that the human brain can be modelled
	as a complex network, and may have a small-world structure both at
	the level of anatomical as well as functional connectivity. This
	small-world structure is hypothesized to reflect an optimal situation
	associated with rapid synchronization and information transfer, minimal
	wiring costs, as well as a balance between local processing and global
	integration. The topological structure of functional networks is
	probably restrained by genetic and anatomical factors, but can be
	modified during tasks. There is also increasing evidence that various
	types of brain disease such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia,
	brain tumours and epilepsy may be associated with deviations of the
	functional network topology from the optimal small-world pattern.},

  abstract = {An important modulatory cell type, found in all molluscan feeding
	networks, was investigated using two-electrode voltage- and current-clamp
	methods. In the cerebral giant cells of Lymnaea, a transient inward
	Na+ current was identified with activation at -58 +/- 2 mV. It was
	sensitive to tetrodotoxin only in high concentrations (approximately
	50\% block at 100 microm), a characteristic of Na+ channels in many
	molluscan neurons. A much smaller low-threshold persistent Na+ current
	(activation at < -90 mV) was also identified. Two purely voltage-sensitive
	outward K+ currents were also found: (i) a transient A-current type
	which was activated at -59 +/- 4 mV and blocked by 4-aminopyridine;
	(ii) a sustained tetraethylammonium-sensitive delayed rectifier current
	which was activated at -47 +/- 2 mV. There was also evidence that
	a third, Ca2+-activated, K+ channel made a contribution to the total
	outward current. No inwardly rectifying currents were found. Two
	Ca2+ currents were characterized: (i) a transient low-voltage (-65
	+/- 2 mV) activated T-type current, which was blocked in NiCl2 (2
	mm) and was completely inactivated at approximately -50 mV; (ii)
	A sustained high voltage (-40 +/- 1 mV) activated current, which
	was blocked in CdCl2 (100 microm) but not in omega-conotoxin GVIA
	(10 microm), omega-agatoxin IVA (500 nm) or nifedipine (10 microm).
	This current was enhanced in Ba2+ saline. Current-clamp experiments
	revealed how these different current types could define the membrane
	potential and firing properties of the cerebral giant cells, which
	are important in shaping the wide-acting modulatory influence of
	this neuron on the rest of the feeding network.},

  abstract = {Stimulus-evoked oscillatory synchronization of neural assemblies has
	been described in the olfactory and visual systems of several vertebrates
	and invertebrates. In locusts, information about odour identity is
	contained in the timing of action potentials in an oscillatory population
	response, suggesting that oscillations may reflect a common reference
	for messages encoded in time. Although the stimulus-evoked oscillatory
	phenomenon is reliable, its roles in sensation, perception, memory
	formation and pattern recognition remain to be demonstrated--a task
	requiring a behavioural paradigm. Using honeybees, we now demonstrate
	that odour encoding involves, as it does in locusts, the oscillatory
	synchronization of assemblies of projection neurons and that this
	synchronization is also selectively abolished by picrotoxin, an antagonist
	of the GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor. By using a behavioural
	learning paradigm, we show that picrotoxin-induced desynchronization
	impairs the discrimination of molecularly similar odorants, but not
	that of dissimilar odorants. It appears, therefore, that oscillatory
	synchronization of neuronal assemblies is functionally relevant,
	and essential for fine sensory discrimination. This suggests that
	oscillatory synchronization and the kind of temporal encoding it
	affords provide an additional dimension by which the brain could
	segment spatially overlapping stimulus representations.},

	in 1850, the mushroom bodies differ in size and complexity between
	taxa, as well as between different castes of a single species of
	social insect. These differences led some early biologists to suggest
	that the mushroom bodies endow an arthropod with intelligence or
	the ability to execute voluntary actions, as opposed to innate behaviors.
	Recent physiological studies and mutant analyses have led to divergent
	interpretations. One interpretation is that the mushroom bodies conditionally
	relay to higher protocerebral centers information about sensory stimuli
	and the context in which they occur. Another interpretation is that
	they play a central role in learning and memory. Anatomical studies
	suggest that arthropod mushroom bodies are predominately associated
	with olfactory pathways except in phylogenetically basal insects.
	The prominent olfactory input to the mushroom body calyces in more
	recent insect orders is an acquired character. An overview of the
	history of research on the mushroom bodies, as well as comparative
	and evolutionary considerations, provides a conceptual framework

	information from the first-order processing area, the antennal lobe,
	to the mushroom body, a higher-order integration center in the insect
	brain. Using Ca2+ imaging, we recorded activity in the dendrites
	of the projection neurons that connect the antennal lobe with the
	mushroom body. Next, we recorded the presynaptic terminals of these
	projection neurons. Finally, we characterized their postsynaptic
	partners, the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body, the clawed
	Kenyon cells. We found fundamental differences in odor coding between
	the antennal lobe and the mushroom body. Odors evoked combinatorial
	activity patterns at all three processing stages, but the spatial
	patterns became progressively sparser along this path. Projection
	neuron dendrites and boutons showed similar response profiles, but
	the boutons were more narrowly tuned to odors. The transmission from
	projection neuron boutons to Kenyon cells was accompanied by a further
	sparsening of the population code. Activated Kenyon cells were highly
	odor specific. Furthermore, the onset of Kenyon cell responses to
	projection neurons occurred within the first 200 ms and complex temporal
	patterns were transformed into brief phasic responses. Thus two types
	of transformations occurred within the MB: sparsening of a combinatorial
	code, mediated by pre- and postsynaptic processing within the mushroom
	body microcircuits, and temporal sharpening of postsynaptic Kenyon
	cell responses, probably involving a broader loop of inhibitory recurrent
	neurons.},

	we previously developed a computationally efficient, morphologically
	inspired "Reduced Model" to expedite tuning the model to produce
	endogenous bursting and alternating bursting when configured as a
	half-center oscillator (paired with reciprocally inhibitory synapses).
	To find conductance density distributions that produce endogenous
	bursting, we implemented a genetic algorithm automated parameter
	search. With multiple searches, we found eight parameter sets that
	produced endogenous bursting in the Reduced Model. When these parameter
	sets were applied to the Full Model, all produced endogenous bursting,
	although when the simulation time was extended from 80 to 300 s,
	only four parameter sets produced sustained bursting in the Reduced
	Models. All parameter sets produced alternating half-center bursting
	in the Reduced and Full Models throughout the entire 300 s. When
	conductance amplitudes were systematically varied for each of the
	four sustained burster sets, the effects on bursting activity differed,
	both for the same parameter set in the Reduced and Full Models and
	for different parameter sets with the same level of morphological
	detail. This implies that morphological detail can affect burst activity
	and that these parameter sets may represent different mechanisms
	for burst generation and/or regulation. We also tested the models
	with parameter variations that correspond to experimental manipulations.
	We conclude that, whereas similar output can be achieved with multiple
	different parameter sets, perturbations such as conductance variations
	can highlight differences. Additionally, this work demonstrates both
	the utility and limitations of using simplified models to represent
	more morphologically accurate models.},

	were preserved. The axial resistances of several compartments were
	rescaled to match the amplitude of synaptic currents and low-threshold
	calcium currents and the shape of action potentials to those in the

	the activity of the Full Model for a variety of simulated current-clamp

	central nervous system, in particular the cerebellum. However, in
	many cases, especially for invertebrates, such coordination is the
	result of direct synaptic connections between small circuits. We
	show here that even the chaotic sequential activity of small model
	networks can be coordinated by electrotonic synapses connecting one

	As an example, we analyzed the coordination and synchronization of
	the sequential activity of two statocyst model networks of the marine

	a key role in postural control of the animal and the generation of
	a complex hunting motor program. Each statocyst network was modeled

	and nonsymmetric inhibitory interactions. We studied how two such
	networks were synchronized by electrical coupling in the presence
	of an external signal which lead to winnerless competition among
	the neurons. We found that as a function of the number and the strength
	of connections between the two networks, it is possible to coordinate
	and synchronize the sequences that each network generates with its
	own chaotic dynamics. In spite of the chaoticity, the coordination
	of the signals is established through an activation sequence lock

	Multiunit auditory activity was demonstrated in the HVc of female

	elicits a large volley in the tracheosyringeal nerve; microstimulating
	the female HVc does not evoke a response in the motor nerve. This
	failure of both auditory and HVc stimulation to elicit a response
	in the female tracheosyringeal nerve is attributed to the lack of
	a functional HVc-nucleus Robustus Archistriatalis projection in females.
	If, as has been suggested, the tracheosyringeal auditory response

	might not process song in the same manner as do males.},

  abstract = {The neurons and mechanisms involved in mammalian spinal cord networks
	that produce rhythmic locomotor activity remain largely undefined.
	Hb9 interneurons, a small population of discretely localized interneurons
	in the mouse spinal cord, are conditionally bursting neurons. Here
	we applied potassium channel blockers with the aim of increasing
	neuronal excitability and observed that under these conditions, postnatal
	Hb9 interneurons exhibited bursts of action potentials with underlying
	voltage-independent spikelets. The bursts were insensitive to antagonists
	to fast chemical synaptic transmission, and the bursting and spikelets
	were blocked by tetrodotoxin. Calcium imaging studies using 2-photon
	excitation in spinal cord slices revealed that clustered Hb9 interneurons
	exhibited synchronous and occasional asynchronous, calcium transients
	that were also insensitive to fast synaptic transmission blockade.
	All transients were blocked by the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone.
	Paired whole cell patch-clamp recordings of Hb9 interneurons in the
	late postnatal mouse revealed common chemical synaptic inputs but
	no evidence of current transfer (i.e., electrotonic coupling) between
	the neurons. However, Hb9 and a previously defined population of
	non-Hb9 interneurons were electrotonically coupled. In the absence
	of fast chemical transmission in the whole spinal cord preparation,
	2-photon excitation calcium imaging revealed bursting activity of
	Hb9 interneurons synchronous with rhythmic ventral root output. Thus
	Hb9 interneurons are both endogenous bursters and rhythmically active
	within a heterogeneous electrotonically coupled network. A network
	with these properties could produce the wide range of stable rhythms
	necessary for locomotor activity.},

	its salience against background stimuli, and that this mechanism
	is a general property of olfactory systems.},

  abstract = {Memories are thought to be due to lasting synaptic modifications in
	the brain. The search for memory traces has relied predominantly
	on determining regions that are necessary for the process. However,
	a more informative approach is to define the smallest sufficient
	set of brain structures. The rutabaga adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme
	that is ubiquitously expressed in the Drosophila brain and that mediates
	synaptic plasticity, is needed exclusively in the Kenyon cells of
	the mushroom bodies for a component of olfactory short-term memory.
	This demonstrates that synaptic plasticity in a small brain region
	can be sufficient for memory formation.},

	supplemented with the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire
	(MEQ). The MCTQ was completed by 5,055 responders, of which 2,481

	of time of mid-sleep on free days (MSF; r = - 0.73) and on workdays
	(MSW; r = - 0.61). MEQ was more strongly correlated with MSF (50\%
	of sleep time) than with sleep onset (0\%), rise time (100\%), or
	with any other percentile (10 to 40, 60\% to 90\%) of sleep on free
	days. The study shows that chronotype (based on MSF as measured by
	the MCTQ) strongly correlates with morningness-eveningness (as measured
	by the MEQ). However, the MCTQ collects additional detailed information
	on sleep-wake behavior under natural conditions.},
