Installed new Qt version onto the "zone" dynamic clamp
computer. Sources wouldn't compile because of the following issues:
a) the static libraries pt_ioctl_tn.a and libnidaqmx.a could not be
located (the Qt creator builds the executibles in StdpC-build-desktop
(in the main stdpc directory) nowadays. Prefixing the files in the
.pro file by "../trunk/staticlib" made them visible again

b) libnidaqmx.a was automatically classified as a dynamically linked
library based on the filename starting with "lib". I.e. the generated
Makefile contained -lnidaqmx.a 
Renaming to nidaqmx.a solved this issue.
