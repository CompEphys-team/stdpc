StdpC is a dynamic clamp software for Windows. It can be used to simulate synapses, gap junctions and ionic currents, and to create hybrid networks of live neurons, neuron models, recordings and stimulation sources. It supports active electrode compensation (AEC) to correct injection artifacts when using single sharp electrodes.
